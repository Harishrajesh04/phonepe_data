# PhonePe Pulse Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview

The PhonePe Pulse Data Analysis Project aims to analyze transaction data to gain insights into digital payment trends across India. By leveraging this data, we aim to uncover patterns and trends in transaction volumes and amounts over time and across different regions.

## Objectives

- **Data Cleaning and Preparation:** Process and clean the raw transaction data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Investigate transaction patterns across various dimensions such as states, years, quarters, and pincodes.
- **Visualization:** Create interactive visualizations using pandas and Plotly to illustrate transaction trends.
- **Insights:** Derive meaningful insights into digital payment behaviors and trends.

## Data

The dataset contains the following columns:
- `States`: The states where transactions took place.
- `Years`: The years during which the transactions occurred.
- `Quarters`: The quarters within the years.
- `Pincodes`: The pincodes associated with the transactions.
- `Transaction_count`: The number of transactions.
- `Transaction_amount`: The total amount transacted.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: For data processing and analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Plotly**: For creating interactive visualizations.
- **visual studio code**: For documenting and running the analysis.
